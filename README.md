# meltdownspectre-patches
Summary of the patch status for Meltdown / Spectre

What?
=====

Meltdown and Spectre are hardware design vulnerabilities in all modern CPUs based on
speculative execution. Background infos:

 * https://spectreattack.com/ or https://meltdownattack.com/ (both pages serve identical content)
 * https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.dk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html

The bug is in the hardware, but mitigations in operating systems are possible and are getting
shipped now. I'm collecting notes on the patch status in various software products. This will
change rapidly and may contain errors. If you have better info please send pull requests.

Linux upstream kernel
=====================

[Kernel Page Table Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation#cite_note-:2-4)
is a mitigation in the Linux Kernel, originally named KAISER.

 * [Version 4.14.11](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.14.11) contains KPTI.
 * [Version 4.15-rc6](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?h=v4.15-rc6) contains KPTI.
 * Longterm support kernels [Version 4.9.75](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.9.75) and [4.4.110](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.4.110) contain KPTI backports.

minipli patches
===============

minipli is an unofficial fork of the former grsecurity patches (original grsecurity is no longer publicly
available). minipli is based on the longterm kernel 4.9, which supports KPTI since
4.9.75, yet the patchset isn't ported yet.

 * [bug report with discussion about backporting KPTI](https://github.com/minipli/linux-unofficial_grsec/issues/25)

Android
=======

 * Fixed with [Android Security Bulletin—January 2018](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2018-01-01).

Windows
=======

 * [Microsoft Advisory](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/adv180002)
 * [Windows Server Guidance](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4072698/windows-server-guidance-to-protect-against-the-speculative-execution-s) and [Windows Client Guidance](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4073119/windows-client-guidance-for-it-pros-to-protect-against-speculative-exe). Note: both links include a Powershell tool to query the status of Windows mitigations for CVE-2017-5715 (branch target injection) and CVE-2017-5754 (rogue data cache load).
   

Apple
====

Apple has already released mitigations in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2 to help defend against Meltdown. 
In the coming days they plan to release mitigations in Safari to help defend against Spectre. They continue to develop and test further mitigations for these issues and will release them in upcoming updates of iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.

 * [Official statement](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208394)
 
The security patch released on December 6, 2017 includes Meltdown mitigation also for Sierra and El Capitan

CPU microcode  
=============

Latest [Intel microcode](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27337) update is 20171117.
It is unclear whether microcode updates are needed and which version contains
them. The microcode update does not contain any changelog.  
If it will become necessary to update Intel (or AMD) microcode under Windows, before the release of official OS-level patches, [this VMware Labs fling](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vmware-cpu-microcode-update-driver) - though formally experimental - can serve the purpose, at least temporarily.

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 15:30 UTC**

It seems that the new Intel’s microcode archive (2017-12-15) provided with the latest Red Hat’s microcode_ctl update includes three new files: 06-3f-02, 06-4f-01, 06-55-04.

Based on what we know:
1. it adds one new CPUID and two MSR for the variant of Spectre that uses indirect branches
2. it forces LFENCE to terminate the execution of all previous instructions, thus having the desired effect for the variant of Spectre that uses conditional branches (out-of-bounds-bypass)

Those IDs belong to the following processor microarchitectures: Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake ([official reference](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-and-processor-identification-with-cpuid-model-and-family-numbers))

**Update - Thu 4 Jan 2018, 16:30 UTC**

Regarding AMD's microcode update: it seems to be only for EPYC (maybe Ryzen, not sure!) and it only adds one of the two MSRs (IA32_PRED_CMD). It uses a different bit than Intel's in the CPUID. It is also for Spectre with indirect branches. Previous microprocessors resolved it with a chicken bit. Please note that the same solution implemented at kernel level works for both Intel and AMD.

**Update - Fri 5 Jan 2018, 03:35 UTC**

Debian Project package maintainers released an [[updated version of the "intel-microcode" package (version 2017-12-15)]](https://packages.debian.org/sid/intel-microcode) for the Sid (unstable) branch olny. Upon inspection, it seems to contain the same microcode additions observed in the Red Hat microcode_ctl update of Thu 4 Jan 2018, 15:30 UTC.
The package in compatible with all Debian-based distributions that support post-boot microcode updates.

Antiviruses
===========

Some Antiviruses do things that break when installing the Windows patches, therefore Microsoft doesn't automatically install the patches on those systems.
